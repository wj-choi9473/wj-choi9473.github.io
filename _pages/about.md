## About Me

```Causal Inference/AI, Quantitative Marketing, Financial Engineering``` 에 관심이 많습니다.  
좀 더 구체적으로 다음과 같은 일을 하며 대체불가능한 problem solver가 되고 싶습니다.
 - 데이터를 통해 인과관계를 파악하고 인사이트를 도출하여 비즈니스 또는 투자 의사결정
 - Context 에 맞는 모델링 및 시스템을 구현

## Work Experience

### December & Company Asset Management

- Data Research  (Feb.2022 - June 2023)
    - As a data scientist, solved complex measurement problems for decision‑making using econometrics and ML/DL, performed consumer data analysis, prediction and causal inference identification.

    1. Research and Implement data science related Academic papers for Business Impact
        - Marketing Optimization and Personalizing Marketing based on ML/DL
            * Built heterogeneous treatment effect models to analyze and predict customers’ positive responses to coupon marketing.
            * Increased conversion rate by 4%p and additional deposit amount by 10%p using the models then base marketing strategy.
        - Build a Data Lake & Data Mart based on academic papers
            * Applied a strategic approach to integrate academic research into practical business implementations, resulting in actionable business strategies, extract valuable insights for financial consumer understanding and informed decision‑making.
        - Key Metric and Dashboard Management
            * Improved existing management metrics and derived new metrics.
            * Monitoring key metrics using Redash and Amplitude
    2. Service Improvement/Decision Making through internal data consultation based on causal inference method
        - Project Scale Determination
            * Evaluated the practicality of existing features with quantitative analysis to decide which features to include in new projects.
            * Achieved resource savings by reducing the time required by more than two months for approximately 80% of development teams, including 20+ from various teams.
        - Evaluation of Investment Algorithm Strategies based on Customer Response
            * Evaluated customers’ AUM (Assets Under Management) based on goal‑based investment strategies and the impact of introducing new services.
    3. Managing Experimentation and Dashboard for Decision Making
        - Create Experiment Module, Methodology and Process
            * Developed AB test processes, templates, and Python modules for experimentation. Educated relevant team members to ensure smooth collaboration.
            * Implemented effective measurement methods, resulting in many updates and marketing actions such as a 50% increase in event banner inflow and prevented a 30% decrease in conversion rate due to new funnels.
        - Experiment Metrics and Dashboard Management
            * Derived metrics for experimentation.
            * Monitoring experiment metrics using Redash and Amplitud
